                <p> 
                    I started my career as an Aerospace Engineer working at Boeing.
                    Over the course of eight years, I advanced from analyzing airplane
                    performance to leading the certification project for Extended
                    Operations (ETOPS) on the 737MAX line of airplanes. As much as I
                    loved working with airplanes, I felt drawn to the expansive world
                    of Tech. In 2017, I left Boeing and started
                    my company, Prusik Development, to focus on the intersection
                    between technology and the outdoor industry. I used Prusik
                    Development to become a self-taught Python developer and to
                    create
                    <a href="https://getyrbeta.com/" target="_blank">Get Yr Beta</a>,
                    an open source web application to
                    facilitate, automate, and coordinate planning logistics for
                    outdoor adventures.
                </p>
                <p><strong>
                    My objective is to combine my background as a project manager
                    and engineer in the aviation industry with my programming and web development
                    experience to complete my transition into the Tech industry.
