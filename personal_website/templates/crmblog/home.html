                    <b>I am an Aerospace Engineer turned Web Developer.</b> I have particular experience 
                    in JavaScript and Python. I am a voracious learner and currently directing my 
                    energy toward applications using a full JavaScript stack with Node.js+Express.js 
                    on the back and React+Redux on the front. I am seeking opportunities to join a 
                    talented team as an entry-level developer. If you like my work, drop me a line below!
                    <br /><br />
                    In 2017, I started Prusik Development. The mission of Prusik Development is to 
                    enable people from non-climbing backgrounds to experience hiking in the Cascade 
                    mountain range with a focus on education and safety. Prusik Development accomplishes 
                    this through mountain-oriented software development and trip leadership. Through 
                    Prusik Development, I built an open source web application, 
                    <a href="https://getyrbeta.com/" target="_blank">Get Yr Beta</a>. 
                    GYB was a project to explore the intersection between my two passions: software development 
                    and mountaineering. Since creating an initial version, GYB has received contributions 
                    from the open source community at the PyCascades developers conference and through 
                    members of the greater GitHub community.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition to software development, I lead mountaineering trips throughout the 
                    Washington mountain ranges. I have helped clients achieve their goals ranging from 
                    a day trip on Mt Si to a summit attempt on Mt Rainier.
                    <br /><br />
                    Prior to transitioning to web development, I was an Aerospace Engineer at Boeing for 
                    8 years. During my final three years at Boeing, I focused on Project Management, leading 
                    a cross-functional team to certification of the 737MAX line of airplanes for Extended 
                    Operations. I love taking on large problems and leveraging the strength of a smart team 
                    to create an optimized solution.
